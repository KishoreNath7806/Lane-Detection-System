A real-time lane detection system for autonomous driving support using OpenCV. 
Applied image preprocessing (grayscale, Gaussian blur), edge detection, and Hough Transform to detect lane lines and overlay them on video frames.
Future integration of machine learning planned for enhanced accuracy in varied conditions.
Technologies: Python, OpenCV
